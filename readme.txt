Use this plugin to make the main menu in the twentyten theme drop down in IE6.

== Description ==

Twentyten is the default theme for WP 3.0 and has beautiful CSS for its menu system. However, if you wanted your menu to drop down in IE6, this does not occur. Use this plugin to make that happen using the jQuery built into WordPress. Many people don't care about browser compatibility back to IE6, so this plugin is for the few that happen to. 


== Installation ==

How to activate:


1. Upload `plugin-name.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Volia!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Shouldn't this be a patch? =

No. Having this function as a plugin will keep the theme light for everyone else to use who is not concerned that their viewers are on IE6.
